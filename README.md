# ML-Coding
This repository contains my progress on ML. Here I will push my code, tell what i have learnt and will update the link of my blogs related to ML.

# Data Preprocessing

*Importing .csv Dataset using pandas

*Fixing the missing fields in the dataset using SimpleImputer class from sklearn library

*Doing Label encoding using preprocessing.LabelEncoder function of sklearn library

*Splitting of dataset into train and test using test_train_split function of sklearn.model_selection library

*Standardization of data before training to maintain mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1

&nbsp; using preprocessing.StandardScaler() from sklearn library

# LinearRegression

*Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib

*Preprocessing the data(Normalization and splitting of data)

*Importing Linear Regression model from sklearn.linear_model library

*Performing Linear regression on training data

*Predicting and Plotting the result

# Fitting Multiple LinearRegression

*Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib

*Preprocessing the data(Label Encoding ,Normalization and splitting of data)

*Performing multiple Linear Regression.

*Predicting the result

# LogisticRegression 

*Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib

*Preprocessing the data(Standardization and splitting of data)

*Training the logistic regression model

*Predicting the result

*Calculating Accuracy of a model

# LogisticRegression Cont.

&nbsp; For the next few days I will be exploring this topic in detail.

# Support Vector Machines (SVM)

&nbsp;Today I learnt the concepts of SVM which includes the Geometric Intuition, the mathematical formulation.

&nbsp;Types of SVM: Hard margin SVM, Soft margin SVM. Kernals in SVM.

# Support Vector Machines (SVM)

&nbsp;Today I wrote a blog on ['Visualizing Support Vector Machine'](https://medium.com/@tiwari.adityacool/visualizing-support-vector-machine-svm-520ad433a54b?sk=01a8b38b1626503711b9edd2de7f0d81) 

# Implementing Support Vector Machine

&nbsp; Starting to work on SVM. Starting by Exploratory data analysis
