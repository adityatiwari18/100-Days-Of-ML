# Day 1 Data Preprocessing

*Importing .csv Dataset using pandas

*Fixing the missing fields in the dataset using SimpleImputer class from sklearn library

*Doing Label encoding using preprocessing.LabelEncoder function of sklearn library

*Splitting of dataset into train and test using test_train_split function of sklearn.model_selection library

*Standardization of data before training to maintain mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1

&nbsp; using preprocessing.StandardScaler() from sklearn library

# Day 2 LinearRegression

*Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib

*Preprocessing the data(Normalization and splitting of data)

*Importing Linear Regression model from sklearn.linear_model library

*Performing Linear regression on training data

*Predicting and Plotting the result
